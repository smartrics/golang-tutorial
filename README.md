# GOLANG tutorial

This is a tutorial entirely designed by ChatGPT. Each part builds on top of the previous. 
Each branch contains the code for the current part.

Understand the goal and requirements, then build the code. 

## Setup

```bash
mkdir golang-tutorial && cd golang-tutorial
go mod init github.com/smartrics/golang-tutorial
```

*Note*: Use your own module name for the project.
